    "* **The IPYNB files must run from top to bottom without errors. We will run your notebook using the following steps: $$\\text{\"Kernel}\\ \\rightarrow\\ \\text{Restart and Run all\"}$$**\n",
    "* **Make sure you are using the correct versions of packages if you are working outside of JupyterHub\n",
    "<font color='red'>(masspy==0.1.6, libroadrunner==2.1.3)</font>**\n",
    "* **Do not leave unneccessary code/comments in the final notebook submission as unorganized code may result in loss of points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. All simulations and figures that you wish to put in the final report should be done in here. Each figure generated must be displayed when the notebook is run. It is recommended to use one cell per figure generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A template has been provided to you below to help with code organization. However, you are free to delete the template and use your own organization in this notebook. The only requirement is that this notebook is organized in a logical manner with descriptive headers to help provide clarity. One file can be submitted with all three case studies, or three files can be submitted seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remember to save all figures you wish to include as a .PDF or .PNG file and be sure to include them in the zip file of your final submission. All figures in the final report should have figure numbers, appropriate axis labels, limits and scale, legends and captions, and be referred in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save all figures in the figures folder provided. This can be done through the `figure.savefig` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** It is recommended to utilize seperate notebooks for each case study to avoid possible errors or artificial results. **Consider duplicating this notebook for each case study performed**. Remember, each case study has a maximum of 3 figures per case study! "
